# PASSWORD-CIRCUIT-BREAKER
PASSWORD CIRCUIT BREAKER CODE IN  8051 ALP ; circuit diagram in proteus
This project is software based simulated in proteus software and can be implemented hardware
Nowadays, electrical accidents to the line man are increasing,while repairing the electrical lines due to the lack of communication between the electrical substation and maintenance staff.
This project gives a solution to this problem to ensure line man safety.â€™
In this proposed system, the control (ON/OFF) of the electrical lines lies with line man.
This project is arranged in such a way that maintenance staff or line man has to enter the password to ON/OFF the electrical line.
Now, if there is any fault in electrical line, then the line man will switch off the power supply to the line by entering password and comfortably repair the electrical line, and after coming to the substation line man switch on the supply to the particular line by entering the password.
Separate passwords are assigned for each electrical lines.
In this project , i have made one line with the password here predefined as "1235" for controlling line.
You can aslo make your own password
# Adding line2/load2 as an improvement to the project
The lines can be controlled after entering the predefined password 
After entering password if it matches then it waits for lineman to enter the line no. 
if the line no. is '1' then line 1 can be contolled i.e to close or open and its status can be displayed in LCD
if the line no. is '2' then line 2 can be contolled i.e to close or open and its status can be displayed in LCD
In same way more lines can be added for controlling them
